## Project #1 - Clean Desktop

This is a project where I want to run every X times, to clean my desktop. I want to store all the information in a folder somewhere on my computer. I don't want to run it all the time, because it can be easier to store my files on the desktop when I am actively using it. That way, I'll be able to use it when needed and move them somewhere.
